|                                                   |         | Total excl. VAT                | €198.72     |
|                                                   |         | VAT - Germany (19% on €198.72) | €37.76      |
|                                                   |         | **Total**                      | **€236.48** |

Our invoices consist of two parts:

* The **second section** (1 Sep - 1 Oct) calculates the price for the **upcoming month** based on the number of users in the workspace

* The **first section** corrects the price for the **previous month** if a user has been added or removed from the workspace

### Section 2: Upcoming month

The second section is calculated as follows:

*Number of users x price per seat*

For example:

*9 users x € 20 EUR = € 180*

### Section 1: Past month

The first section is calculated as follows:

In the previous invoice, the amount paid billed was € 120, based on 6 workspace users (see how the second section above is calculated).

This invoice corrects this amount as 3 users were added to the workspace:

* One user was added on 16 Aug, as shown by the remaining time for 7 users in the workspace in the first row. For 15 days, 7 licenses cost €67.74.

* The unused time below deducts the amount already paid in the previous invoice. These 6 licenses in the previous invoice lead to €58.06, deducted from the €67.74.

***

Two more users were added on 24 Aug, leading to €40.65 for the remaining month (9 users for 8 days).
As 6 users were already billed in the previous invoice and 1 user was already charged in the remaining time from 16 Aug above, the price for 7 users is deducted from this amount (€31.61).

***

The total amount consists of the correction of the current month plus the price for the next month:

*Section 1 price + Section 2 price = Total amount*

*Price of the current month + Price of the next month = Total amount*

*= \[Price for 1 license for 15 days + Price for 2 licenses for 8 days] + Price for the next month = Total amount*

*= \[ ( € 67.74 - € 58.06 ) + ( € 40.65 - € 31.61 ) ] + € 180  = € 198.72*
