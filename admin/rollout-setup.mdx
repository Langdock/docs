## What is different when rolling out AI compared to other software?

Over the past decades, we have seen and used deterministic software, like CRMs, ERP systems, wikis, word editors and many more. The entire workforce today can use computers and these software tools. Simplified speaking, deterministic software means that if you click on button x, always action y happens.

Compared to this "traditional" behavior, if you send the same prompt to an AI model, the response will never be 100% the same. This is because AI models are stochastic software.

The benefit is that AI is highly customizable and can be utilized in every area of your organization. The downside is that it requires education and training of users. At the same time, rolling out AI internally brings the chance to improve a lot of processes and users are really excited of trying this new software and advance their skills.

## The ideal setup

### Leadership buy-in

The companies who have the highest adoption of AI and thus the highest productivity gains have AI deeply embedded in their strategy, and leadership pushes this topic. It is not only owned by IT or a smaller department but by C-level members. They regularly make the topic a key priority, create visibility internally and externally and convince departments and their people to try and experiment to find use cases.

To have this support internally makes it easier for everybody involved, because it allows to experiment, to try things out and learn. For leadership, rolling out AI allows to future-proof the company and streamline operations.

### Internal AI owner / team

We recommend to have (at least) one AI owner in the company: Hire or assign one person whose main job is only to adopt AI and improve processes with AI. This is often a Chief AI officer, innovation manager, member of the digital team etc.

This is a great opportunity for both the company and the person taking over this responsibility: The company invests personnel costs into adopting AI, often times much more efficient than buying the most expensive tool. For the AI owner this can be a great opportunity since the role shapes processes across the entire company, collaborates with all departments, and often has board exposure since AI is a top priority for leadership.

### AI champions

One important job of the AI person is to find champions in each department. They should learn as much as possible about Langdock and AI and transfer this knowledge to people across different departments. In the departments, you have people who are power users and very excited about AI. Usually, there are many people interested in becoming early adopters of AI, and they are often in test groups. They give feedback, help with building use cases and bridge between their colleagues in the departments and the AI owner.
