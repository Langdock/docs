We're excited to announce the release of several new features that make Langdock even more powerful and user-friendly. Our team has been working tirelessly to improve your experience and we're thrilled to share these updates with you:

### Support for More Models üåê

Anthropic Claude: Claude is renowned for its ability to generate human-like text and is a great addition to our roster.
Meta Llama 2 Chat: With Meta's new language model, we bring the first open-source LLM to Langdock (hosted in the EU).
Aleph Alpha Luminous: Aleph Alpha is a powerful language model that has been released by the German research company Aleph Alpha.

### File Uploads Support üìÅ

We understand that efficient collaboration often involves sharing files and documents. With our new file uploads feature, you can now upload files directly into the chat and ask questions related to them. This adds a new layer of convenience and productivity to your team collaboration.

### Share Conversations üîó

Ever wished you could share a productive discussion with a teammate who wasn't part of it? Now you can! With our new conversation sharing feature, you can share entire conversation threads with others, ensuring everyone stays in the loop.

### Prompt Library üìö

To assist you in generating more meaningful and effective conversations, we've introduced a prompt library. Here, you'll find a collection of pre-formatted prompts that you can use to initiate discussions, ask questions, or guide the conversation in a specific direction.

We hope you're as excited about these new features as we are! As always, we continue to work on making Langdock the best it can be, and we appreciate your support and feedback.
