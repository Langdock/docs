Langdock is built for using AI to work with your internal company knowledge. For processing this knowledge effectively, we provide different integrations. Every day, our system will check for updates in the selected items and re-import these automatically, including subfolders.

## How to open the integrations menu
To connect your integrations go to the chat and select the "custom" chat in the lower left corner of the chat field. You should see a window with the integrations menu now.

Another way to get here is to click on "+ File" next to the model selector and then on "Select files".

## Integration Types

### Files
You can upload text-based files to Langdock. The supported file types are PDF, docx, md, txt and pptx. But in the files, Langdock can only process texts. So if you upload a presentation with many image, the context might not be understood completely and response quality could decrease. 

There is no limit how many files you can upload, although the less files you select for your prompt or assistant, the better the responses will be.

### Web
You can add websites by adding a URL. If you want to, you can also import subpages - so if I enter https://langdock.com/, the tool also searches through https://langdock.com/pricing to answer my prompt. 

When it comes to web crawling, different strategies can be employed to navigate and index the content of a domain. Here's an explanation of the three crawling modes you can use:

**Load All Pages of the Domain**

- This mode involves the crawler systematically visiting every page that it can find on a specific domain. The crawler starts from a known page, often the homepage, and follows every link it encounters that leads to another page within the same domain until all reachable pages have been loaded.

- This approach is very thorough and makes sure that every public page on the domain is crawled, even content that is not linked from the main pages or sitemap. However, it is the most time-consuming option and can take a long time to complete


**Load Children of the Webpage**

- In this mode, the crawler is focused on a specific webpage and only loads pages that are directly linked from this page, often referred to as its "children." This is a more targeted approach where the crawler doesn't aim to index the entire domain but is interested in the content that is directly reachable from a specific starting point.

- This is a faster and more efficient approach than the previous one. It can miss important content if it is not linked on the target page, so it is useful when exploring a field of related content

**Use the Sitemap of the Domain**

- Many websites provide sitemaps, which are files that list the URLs of a site along with additional metadata about each URL (like when it was last updated, how often it changes, and its importance relative to other URLs). Crawlers can use this information to more intelligently index the site.

- The sitemap allows the crawler to work more efficiently and prioritize important changes. The downside is that not all sites have sitemaps and some might be outdated and decrease the effectiveness of the crawling.



Please keep in mind that some pages and services restrict crawling them technically (crawlers are blocked) or legally (restricting crawling in their terms).

### Text
If you have a very long text (like an email thread or pasted text from a different source), you can save it in Langdock without having to save it elsewhere and then upload it to Langdock. Once you select the text, it will behave exactly the same like a PDF or other files.

One more thing to consider: We increased the context window here, so if you want to process a long text with full text retrieval, you can do this here.

### Confluence, Notion, Google Drive, OneDrive, Sharepoint and Slack
On the left you can see different integrations. Connecting each tool works very similarly. Let's go through connecting a Google Drive as an example step by step:

1. Select the integration you want to connect in the list on the left. In our case, this is Google Drive.

2. You should see a screen saying "Connect your Google Drive account". Press the button "Connect" in the center.

3. You are redirected to the integration process of the individual tool. The design looks different in each tool, but the steps are the same. In the first step, please select the account you want to connect.

4. You are asked whether you want to continue, because data will be shared with Langdock. Click "Continue".

5. The integration shows you which data will be shared with Langdock. To process your files and use them as your knowledge within Langdock, Langdock needs to see, view and download files. With "Allow" you are giving consent to share files.

6. You are now back in Langdock and can select which files you want to import as knowledge. In our case, let's import the personal drive only. With large integrations it can take a while to import the data completely. If you want to get started quickly, try to select only the minimum of files you need right now.

7. Now, the import has started and will run in the background. Now we have to wait for the integrations to be imported. Press "Ok, understood".

8. You can see all files of the Google Drive in a list now. Towards the right side, there is a status of the file indicated. Once the import is complete, it will change to "Imported"

Now you can select the files you want to use as knowledge in your chat or assistant by ticking the box on the left side. Generally, it is advised to select as few sources as possible to provide accurate results.
