You can find our pricing [here](https://www.langdock.com/pricing). The base of our pricing is a seat-based pricing model for users in your Langdock account. For features where usage and costs do not necessarily correlate with the number of users, our [usage-based pricing](https://www.langdock.com/models) is used. Features like this are API requests in the API product. 

Our pricing is reduced in steps for accounts above 50 users, depending on the number of users.

Specific options, like custom onboarding, dedicated support, and dedicated deployment (on-premise and cloud), are only available in the enterprise tier with more than 100 users.
