 ## Prerequisites
- A Langdock workspace on the Enterprise plan.
- Access to an admin account in your Langdock workspace.
- An Entra ID account with the ability to create and manage Enterprise applications.

## Create a new Enterprise application in Entra ID
First, you need to create a new Enterprise application in your Entra ID portal.  <br />
To do this, follow these steps:

1. In your Entra ID portal navigate to the Overview page and add a new Enterprise application under "+ Add" -> "Enterprise application".

2. Create a new custom application by clicking on "+ Create your own application".

3. Name your application (e.g. "Langdock")

4. Select the option "Integrate any other application you don't find in the gallery (Non-gallery)"

## SAML Configuration
After creating the application, you need to configure the SAML settings, which will allow Langdock to authenticate users via SAML.

First, navigate to the "Sing sign-on" settings of your newly created application, by selecting "Set Up SSO". Set up single sign-on" and choosing "SAML" as the single sign-on method.

Next, you need to get the SAML metadata from Langdock, which you can find in your [Security settings](https://app.langdock.com/workspace/security), after activating the "SAML Active" toggle.

Here, you need to copy two values from the SAML metadata:

1. The "Audience URI (SP Entity ID)" value (langdock.com)
2. The "Single Sign-On URL" value

Now, you can configure the SAML settings in your Entra ID portal, by first clicking "Edit" in the "Basic SAML Configuration" section, and then filling in the following values:

1. "Identifier (Entity ID)": The "Audience URI (SP Entity ID)" value from Langdock
2. "Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)": The "Single Sign-On URL" value from Langdock
3. "Sign on URL": The "Single Sign-On URL" value from Langdock

You can leave the other fields empty or with their default values. Finally, save the configuration by clicking "Save".

To finalize the SAML setup, you need to copy the Login URL and the SAML Signing certificate from Entra ID to Langdock.

1. In the "SAML Signing Certificate" section of your Entra ID portal, click on "Download" next to "Certificate (Base64)" link to download the certificate. You have to open the certificate in a text editor and copy the content. This will be in the format of:

```
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----
...
-----END CERTIFICATE-----
```

2. Copy the "Login URL" value from the "Set up Langdock" section in your Entra ID portal.

In your Langdock workspace, navigate to the [Security settings](https://app.langdock.com/workspace/security) again and paste the copied values into the respective fields:

1. Fill in the "Issuer" field with the Audience URI specified earlier (`langdock.com`).
2. Paste the "Login URL" value from Entra ID into the "Sign on URL" field.
3. Paste the SAML Signing certificate content into the "Certificate" field.

## Test the SAML setup

To test the SAML setup, open seperate browser or an incognito window and navigate to [https://app.langdock.com](https://app.langdock.com). <br />
Enter an email address of a user in your Entra ID account and click "Continue". <br />
You will be redirected to the Entra ID login page, where you can enter your credentials. <br />
After successful authentication, you will be redirected back to Langdock and logged in.
