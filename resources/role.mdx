title: '6) Give the LLM a Role'
---

When interacting with an LLM, you can significantly enhance its performance by assigning it a specific role. This technique, known as "priming", involves instructing the LLM to adopt the perspective or expertise of a particular character or professional. By doing so, the LLM can generate more relevant, accurate, and contextually appropriate responses tailored to your needs.

For example, if you need project management advice, you can prime the LLM to act as a project manager. If you need marketing strategies, you can prime it to act as a marketing consultant. This approach helps the LLM focus on the relevant knowledge and language patterns associated with that role, leading to better and more useful outputs.
