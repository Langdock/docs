## Shortcuts

There are shortcuts to perform key operations in Langdock.

All users can load the prompts from the prompt library into the chat field with `/`. You can find out more about the prompt library [here](/product/chat/prompt-library).

## CMD + K

The shortcut `CMD` + `K` (Mac) or `Ctrl` + `K` (Windows) opens a window where you search your chat history or search through all settings.

For example, you can:

* Type in a keyword to search a chat

* Type in the name of a pinned assistant to go to a new chat with this assistant

* Type in "language" or "dark mode" to change the language or switch to dark / light mode

## Paste URL of document to attach it

As explained here, you can attach files and pages from your integrations to a chat or to an assistant. There are two ways to do that:

* You can either search for the name to look through all files.

* Or you paste the URL of the according file in the search field or in the chat to find and attach the file.
