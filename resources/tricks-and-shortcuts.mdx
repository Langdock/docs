## Shortcuts

There are shortcuts to perform key operations in Langdock.

All users can load the prompts from the prompt library into the chat field with `/`. You can find out more about the prompt library [here](/product/chat/prompt-library).

Here is a list of all the other shortcuts for Mac Users:

## CMD + K

The shortcut `CMD` + `K` (Mac) or `Ctrl` + `K` (Windows) opens a window where you search your chat history or search through all settings.

For example, you can:

* Type in a keyword to search a chat

* Type in the name of a pinned assistant to go to a new chat with this assistant

* Type in "language" or "dark mode" to change the language or switch to dark / light mode

## Paste URL of document to attach it

As explained here, you can attach files and pages from your integrations to a chat or to an assistant. There are two ways to do that:

* You can either search for the name to look through all files.

* Or you paste the URL of the according file in the search field or in the chat to find and attach the file.

## Langdock App (Desktop, mobile)

We have developed a progressive web app (PWA), which allows you to install the app on your desktop and do not have to open the browser every time to access it. To install it, you can open the browser, go to app.langdock.com and then click on the **Install** button in the navbar. You can then add the app on your desktop or in the task bar.
