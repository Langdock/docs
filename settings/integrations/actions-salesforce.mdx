## Prerequisites

This guide helps you to set up an assistant action for Salesforce. Before proceeding, we recommend to read the following guide [Introduction to Actions](/resources/integrations/create-actions).

In Salesforce, you will need to create Lightning Apps and set up authentication with OAuth tokens. You need to have permissions to create an app in Salesforce. Here are some additional resources:

* [Create Lightning Apps in Salesforce](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.apps_lightning_create.htm\&type=5)

* [Managing OAuth Tokens and Scopes](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=sf.remoteaccess_oauth_tokens_scopes.htm\&type=5)

* [Salesforce API Documentation](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/apis)

This guide helps you to integrate Salesforce to Langdock using the [Rest API](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/atlas.en-us.api_rest.meta/api_rest/intro_what_is_rest_api.htm). You can retrieve data or update data from Salesforce in Langdock. If you use other Salesforce solutions, the process with the app and the authentication will be the same, but you will need a different OpenAPI Schema. You can find the different Salesforce APIs [here](https://developer.salesforce.com/docs/apis).

## Setup

### 1. Assistant instructions

Create a new assistant. If you are new to creating assistants, you can read more about how to create assistants and write instructions in our \[assistant guide]\(https://docs.langdock.com/resources/assistant-creation and our [prompt engineering guide](/resources/prompt-elements). Paste the following instructions into the according field.

```
**Persona:** You are the Salesforce assistant. Your job is to pull information from Salesforce, and create and update objects.


**Task:**
When a user asks you to retrieve information about an object, perform the according getSObject action. If you should create an object, perform the according createSObject action. If you should update or patch an object, perform the updateSObject action.


**Example:**
User: Show me the properties of <Object>.
```

### 2. OpenAPI Schema

Scroll to the bottom of the assistant configuration and click on **New Action**. Here you can configure actions and API requests to other tools. Copy the text below into the field **OpenAPI Schema**. You can also try out [action assistant](/resources/actions-assistant) to write the OpenAPI schema.

Make sure to replace the base URL with your account’s base URL and replace XX.X with the Salesforce instance version. [Here](https://help.salesforce.com/s/articleView?id=000386929\&type=1) you can find more about the instance version.

Also, replace the objects with the objects defined in your instance.

## Authentication

### 3. Salesforce App

Go to your Salesforce application and create a new app:

1. Navigate to the **Setup** page.
  ![](/images/actions-sf-1.png)

2. Search for **App Manager**
  ![](/images/actions-sf-2.png)

3. Click on **New connected app** and then on **Create an External Client App** with OAuth 2.0.
  ![](/images/actions-sf-3.png)

4. Enter a name for your app, e.g. “Langdock”

5. Enter your email address as the contact email

6. Enable OAuth by checking the according box

7. Add a callback URL placeholder. This can be any URL and will be updated at the end.
  ![](/images/actions-sf-4.png)
