You can reach out to support@langdock.com to set up your integration together in a call.

**Important:**

* You need to be a workspace-admin to connect a Confluence Space for the entire workspace. If you are not an admin, please reach out to your admin or refer to the [user-level integration guide](/product/integrations/oauth).

## Part 1: Import the Langdock App in your Confluence Space.

1. Navigate to your Atlassian plugin settings in a new tab: <br />

2. Open the settings and check if **Verify private listings** and **Enable Development Mode** is checked. If not, check the boxes and click “Apply”. The development mode is only temporary, while the Langdock app is being verified by Atlassian.![Enable Development mode and private listings](/images/confluence-app-import-3.png)

   than a year from the date of creation.
