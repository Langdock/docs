    Click **Add New** and fill out the fields:
        - Client ID is unique id of your service account
        - OAuth scopes should be the following: ```https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.group.readonly, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.directory.user.readonly, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/drive.readonly, https://www.googleapis.com/auth/admin.reports.audit.readonly```

```
-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----
...
-----END PRIVATE KEY-----\n
```

Add the service account email and the Google administrators' email of the Google Drive service account to the according fields in Langdock.

12. Click on **Save**.
