description: 'Connect Integrations for one individual user only.'

There are two different types of integrations in Langdock: Integrations that every user can set up for themselves using OAuth2 and integrations that can be set up by the admin for everyone in the workspace.

To set up different integrations using OAuth2, please refer to this guide.

The guides to set up integrations as an admin can be found here:

* [Google Drive](/product/integrations/drive)

* [Confluence](/product/integrations/confluence)

## Connecting an OAuth integration (only for yourself)

1. Go to your [integrations](https://app.langdock.com/integrations).
  ![Select Google Account](/images/new-integration-1.png)

2. Click on "Add integration".

3. You have the choice to add integrations. Select the integration you want to connect. If you are an admin and want to connect a tool just for yourself, choose the option called "only you" as the integration is just for you and no other user.

4. You are redirected to the integration process of the individual tool. The design looks different in each tool, but the steps are the same.

5. In the first step, please select the account you want to connect:

6. You are asked whether you want to continue because data will be shared with Langdock. Click "Continue".

7. The integration shows you which data will be shared with Langdock. To process and use your files as your knowledge within Langdock, Langdock needs to see, view and download files. With "Allow", you are giving consent to share files.

8. You are directed back to your Langdock account. A successfully integrated tool will look like this:

If this did not work, please contact us through: [support@langdock.com](mailto:support@langdock.com)

You can now attach files from your integration to assistants or to chats by clicking on the paperclip or the "Attach knowledge" button. It is sorted by priority (how often you used it recently and how often you accessed this file through Langdock). We also build a search bar to find the right file easily.
