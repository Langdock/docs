title: 'Fair Usage Policy'
description: 'Langdock has limits of prompts per user per time frame to ensure that all users can use all models at any time.'
---

## Reasoning
Our Fair Usage Policy limits prompts per time frame to allow all users access to all models without a single user negatively impacting the service for others by monopolizing model capacities. It is designed to prevent abuse and ensure reliability and availability for the overall user base.

## Implementation
If a user exceeds the allowed limits, they can switch to a different model. However, 99% of all users never hit this limit, and the limit is only temporary.

As LLMs have different prices and different demands, we structured them into different categories:
- Category 1 includes smaller, faster models. They allow unlimited requests, although there is still spam protection against abuse.
- Category 2 models can receive 200 messages in three hours.
- Category 3 models allow 100 messages in three hours.
