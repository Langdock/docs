## Profile
The profile section allows you to upload an image and change your name, email, and password.
To change an email address, contact support (support@langdock.com).

## Preferences
Depending on your experience and your preferences, you can configure your account to suit your individual needs.

You can select a default model. This model is selected in every new chat unless you change it in the top left corner.

You can enable or disable chat capabilities like web search, image generation, or data analysis. Without the ability, no chat in your account will be able to use the according capability.

Below that, you can set the app language. Currently, we support English and German.

## Custom Instructions
You can add information about yourself or how the answers should be written in the settings. This text applies to all messages you send to an AI model. In the resources section, you find a [guide with examples](https://docs.langdock.com/resources/custom-instructions) of what to add in custom instructions to.

## Data Folders
In the chat and assistants, you can add up to 20 files and send them with your prompt to the mode. This is due to the limited amount of information the models can process simultaneously (= Context window, see **this guide** for details about sending documents in the context window).

To add more than 20 files, you can create data folders in the settings. Here, you can add up to 1,000 files in one folder. This folder can then be attached to assistants and found in the Search feature. With this feature, the number of files can easily surpass the context window size of the model (the text in attached folders can be longer than the processing limit of the model). The model is split into different sections. Then, relevant sections for answering the user prompt are identified, and only these relevant text sections are sent to the model in the context window. This data folder feature allows us to work with large document numbers but reduces accuracy, as not every part of the documents is considered.

## Privacy
