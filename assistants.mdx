## Assistants
Assistants are LLM-based chat interfaces that can be enriched with your company's internal data. You can integrate your company knowledge into an assistant.

## Assistant Builder
The Assistant Builder enables you to set up and configure your own custom assistants. We offer an interface that lets you configure the characteristics and capabilities of your assistant. 
To build a useful assistant, there are a few variables you need to define and you can start using your own assistants within just a few moments. 

## Use cases
There is a wide range of use cases for Assistants. From Onboarding Assistance or an IT-Helpdesk to building an assistant that knows everything about your user manual.
Here are just a few of the wide-ranging examples: 
#### HR ####
Integrate your employees handbook, your onboarding checklists, or your benefits information. Your employees can now ask your assistant everything that can be answered with these documents.  
#### Onboarding ####
Incorporate the assistant into the onboarding process to answer common questions for new hires about company policies, specific job functions, training timelines, and necessary paperwork. This can help new employees acclimate more quickly and find information when needed.
#### Customer Support ####
Equip your customer support with an assistant that has access to FAQs, product details, and service protocols. The assistant can provide information, assist with troubleshooting, and navigate customers through product or service issues, aiming to resolve queries efficiently.

## Assistants vs Chat
Chats function as a daily companion for employees, allowing brainstorming, drafting emails, and debugging code with integrations to internal knowledge. They support collaboration, sharing prompts, and are customizable with security measures.

Assistants are built to integrate internal knowledge, deployable within Langdock or other apps like Slack and Microsoft Teams, aimed at streamlining information access. They can handle specific tasks like HR queries, onboarding, and customer support, with a focus on data security and compliance. These tasks are just examples. The range of use cases is infinitely long.
