title: 'Shared Teams Channels'
description: 'We have shared Slack or Teams channels between users and our product team, depending on how we support the customer during rollout. This guide helps you to set set the permissions.'

The channels are used for different things:
- **Quick answers:** We usually answer within a few minutes and a shared channel helps your team members if they have similar questions.
- **Receiving updates:** All updates are shared in the channels.
- **Exchanging use cases:** In our experience, a shared channel where users share their use cases and learn with each other has the highest correlation with activity of users and the value your teams get from AI.

## Setup

The setup depends on the internal permissions set by your Microsoft admin. We usually try 1. to set up the channel together. If it does not work, we have collected guides from Microsoft to set them up in 2. and 3.

### 1. Setting up a shared channel

The Langdock team can set up a shared channel and invite you to it. Afterwards, you can invite the other Langdock users from your team to join the channel.

If you want the Langdock team to join an existing channel, you can invite the according users by clicking on "Participants" in the top right corner

By default, setting up channels with externals is enabled in Microsoft. If the set up did not work, the sharing of channels with other organisations needs to be enabled by an admin in Microsoft. To do that, follow the guide 2. below.

### 2. Enabling shared Channels in Teams (Microsoft Admin)

The following guide is taken from [this guide](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/solutions/collaborate-teams-direct-connect?view=o365-worldwide) from Microsoft 365. You also find a video detailing the steps [here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/videoplayer/embed/RE4WRMx?autoplay=false&postJsllMsg=true)

You **do not need to specify a link** to your internal process for requesting new external organizations" ([this section](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/solutions/collaborate-teams-direct-connect?view=o365-worldwide#specify-a-link-to-your-internal-process-for-requesting-new-external-organizations)).

Also, you can choose whether the Langdock team should invite you to a channel or whether you want to set up the channel. Depending on that, you only need to configure [inbound settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/solutions/collaborate-teams-direct-connect?view=o365-worldwide#configure-inbound-settings) (= you invite Langdock as externals) or [outbound settings](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-365/solutions/collaborate-teams-direct-connect?view=o365-worldwide#configure-inbound-settings) (= we invite you)


In some cases, permissions may not be changed in the Teams space. In this case, you can create a second teams space to invite the Langdock team (see 3).

### 3. Creating a shared Teams-Space

Follow these guides to set up a team.
- [This guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/create-a-team-from-scratch-in-microsoft-teams-174adf5f-846b-4780-b765-de1a0a737e2b) refers to setting up a team from scratch.
- Follow [this guide](https://support.microsoft.com/en-au/office/create-a-team-from-an-existing-team-or-group-in-microsoft-teams-f41a759b-3101-4af6-93bd-6aba0e5d7635) to set up a new team from an existing team.

Then, refer to 1. and 2. to set up a shared channel.
