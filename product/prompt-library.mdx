If you like a prompt and want to reuse it in the future, there is a [prompt library](https://platform.langdock.com/prompt-library) to store it.

## How to add a prompt to the prompt library
You can add a prompt in two ways:

 1. If you like a prompt and want to reuse it in the future, save it by clicking on the `+` icon. You will need to choose a _folder*_ where you want to save your prompt and give it a name.
2. Go directly to the library and click "Add Prompts" in the upper right corner. Here, you can enter the prompt's name, the actual prompt, and specify where to publish it.

_Folders*_: You can create folders to organize your prompts. When creating a folder, you must define its name and specify its sharing settings—whether it is shared only with you, with the entire workspace, or with a specific group.

## How to use prompts from the prompt library
An example of a prompt in our library is:


`Porter’s five forces`

`You are an expert consultant. I want to create an overview of Porter's five forces for [company]. Prepare a deep analysis for each of the five competitive forces. Please reply in bullet points for each of the competitive forces.`<br />

`The five forces are:`<br />
- `Competition in the industry`<br />
- `Potential of new entrants into the industry`<br />
- `Power of suppliers`<br />
- `Power of customers`<br />
- `Threat of substitute products`

When we use this prompt, we replace `[company]` with the company we want to analyze.

To access a prompt, click on it in the prompt library or type `/` in the chat field and access it in the list to quickly access prompts. To filter the list, type in the name of the prompt.

## How to categorize prompts in groups and folders
Prompts can be saved only for yourself, to groups or the entire workspace.

Admins can publish prompts to the entire workspace.

All other users can publish their prompts to groups they are members in (more about groups [here](/product/groups)) and folders you have created.
