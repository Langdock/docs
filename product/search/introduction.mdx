title: 'Search'
description: 'Langdock Search is a functionality that allows users to search files, pages, and content across all connected tools.'

<Info>This feature is currently in Beta and only available for some test users.</Info>

## Set up
Admins can enable the Search product in the admin [admin settings](https://app.langdock.com/settings/workspace/products/search). More details can be found **[here]**.

## Using search 
After your admins have enabled the product, you will find a “Search” item in the navigation bar on the left.

Here, you can search for files across all integrations. Both the content and the title are searched.

With the search results, you can do two things:

- Open the file: You can click on the search result to open it. This will bring you to the app where the file was found. If it is a Google Doc, it will open the Google Doc; if the file is a Confluence page, it will open it in Confluence.
- Start a chat with the file. If you hover over the search result, you will see a button “Start chat” appear. If you click this, the file will be attached to a new chat, and you can interact with it individually. This will allow you to summarize it, ask questions about it, etc.

## Filters
On the right, you have some filters to filter your results. If you know that you are looking for a specific file type or know that the file is in a specific integration or was created in a specific timeframe, you can narrow down the search results here.

## Integrations
Currently, Search supports the following integrations:
- SharePoint
- OneDrive
- Confluence
- Google Drive
- Slack

More integrations to be searchable will follow in the next weeks and months. We are looking forward to hearing your feedback and which integrations you would like to see in Search, so we can plan accordingly. Feel free to send your feedback to thomas@langdock.com!
