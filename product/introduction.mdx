## Welcome to Langdock's Product Guide!

We provide five distinct products in one platform:

* [Chat:](/product/chat/plain-model) A simple interface where you can “chat” with an AI model.

* [Assistants:](/product/assistants/introduction) You can build your own chatbots for specific tasks or situations.

* [Search:](/product/search/introduction) This allows you to search across all connected integrations and easily find the right information across several sources.

* [API:](/product/api) Use AI models in other applications or build your own products, which are enabled by the Langdock AI models.

* **Agents (coming soon):** Programmatically build AI workflows with several steps across several tools.

If you have any questions or feedback, send us an email to [support@langdock.com](mailto:support@langdock.com) or use the support chat on the bottom right.
