## Welcome to Langdock's Product Guide!

We provide five distinct products in one platform:
- **Chat:** A simple interface where you can “chat” with an AI model. 
- **Assistants:** You can build your own chatbots for specific tasks or situations.
- **Search:** This allows you to search across all connected integrations and easily find the right information across several sources.
- **API:** Use AI models in other applications or build your own products, which are enabled by the Langdock AI models.
- **Agents (coming soon):** Programmatically build AI workflows with several steps across several tools.

If you have any questions or feedback, send us an email to support@langdock.com or use the support chat on the bottom right.
