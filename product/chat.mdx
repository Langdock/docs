Langdock AI Chat is the central feature Langdock is built on. It boosts your efficiency by leveraging the latest language models, allowing for web browsing, document uploads, analysis, and image generation. 

This guide explains all the features related to chat.

To learn how you use different tools in the chat, you can read our page about capabilities [here](/product/chat-capabilities).

## Prompt Actions

### Edit Prompt
If you are unsatisfied with a response, you can edit the instructions by clicking on the pen icon next to your prompt. Click save when you are ready.

### Save Prompt
If you like a prompt and want to reuse it in the future, save it by clicking on the “+” icon. You need to choose a folder where you want to save your prompt in the prompt library and give your prompt a name. You can learn more about it [here](/product/prompt-library).

### Regenerate Prompt
If you are unsatisfied with the response you received, simply click on the circular arrow below your response to regenerate it. This feature is particularly useful because models are non-deterministic, meaning you will always get a slightly different result for the same prompt. You can then review the various responses and select the one that best meets your needs.

## Models
You can enhance your prompting experience by selecting different models from the model selection field, located in the upper left corner of the chat interface.

Langdock positions itself as a model-agnostic tool, committed to providing you with flexibility and freedom of choice, rather than locking you into a single model.

Each model has its own unique strengths, and we encourage you to explore and test different models to find the best fit for your needs. Find out about different models [here](/product/models).
