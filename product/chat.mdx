Langdock AI Chat is the central feature Langdock is built on. It boosts your efficiency by leveraging the latest language models, allowing for web browsing, document uploads, analysis, and image generation. 

This guide explains all the features and modes related to chat.


## Chat Modes ##
Langdock automatically chooses the best mode for your message, depending on your query. 

### Plain Mode ###
Use the model without additional data with the plain mode. This is the traditional mode that you might know from ChatGPT. When asking for general knowledge or performing tasks where no additional input apart from your prompt is needed, this mode will be used.

### Document Upload & Search ###
Effortlessly upload your files from your desktop or seamlessly select them from your connected integrations.

Click on the paper click in the left corner of the chat input field to either upload files or select files from your connected integrations.

Integrations need to be enabled by the admin of your Langdock workspace. You can learn more about integrations you can connect [here](/integrations).

_Langdock supports document upload for the following file formats:_
- PDF
- Word /Google Docs 
- PowerPoint
- TXT
- Markdown
- Excel / Google Sheets / csv. documents → `coming soon`


### Web Browsing Mode ###
Use this mode to search the web and generate replies based on real-time data. This allows the model to access and utilize the latest information on current events, recent developments, and other topics that require up-to-date data. 

Prompt the model by saying `Search the web for...` to leverage this capability.


### Image Generation Mode ###
Generate images and logos from text input using DALL-E 3, expanding the scope of creative and visual outputs. 

You can prompt the model to create an image by writing `Create an image`.

### Image Analysis Mode ###
In Langdock, you can process uploaded images and analyze them. Ensure you select GPT-4o or one of the Claude models in the model selection field (upper left corner of the chat interface). <br /> You can upload PNG or JPG files by clicking on the paper clip in the left corner of the chat input field.
<br />Then, write a prompt to instruct the model what you are trying to do. You can analyze, describe, extract text from an image, or compare several photos.

## Prompt Actions ##

### Edit Prompt ###
If you are unsatisfied with a response, you can edit the instructions by clicking on the pen icon next to your prompt. Click save when you are ready.

### Save Prompt ###
If you like a prompt and want to reuse it in the future, save it by clicking on the “+” icon. You need to choose a folder where you want to save your prompt in the prompt library and give your prompt a name. You can learn more about it [here](/product/prompt-library).

### Regenerate Prompt ###
If you are unsatisfied with the response you received, simply click on the circular arrow below your response to regenerate it. This feature is particularly useful because models are non-deterministic, meaning you will always get a slightly different result for the same prompt. You can then review the various responses and select the one that best meets your needs.

## Models ##
You can enhance your prompting experience by selecting different models from the model selection field, located in the upper left corner of the chat interface.
<br /> Langdock positions itself as a model-agnostic tool, committed to providing you with flexibility and freedom of choice, rather than locking you into a single model.
<br /> Each model has its own unique strengths, and we encourage you to explore and test different models to find the best fit for your needs. Find out about different models [here](/product/models).
