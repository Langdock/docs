Assistants are LLM-based chat interfaces that can be enriched with your company’s internal data. They are typically designed to accomplish recurring, specific tasks.

This guide will help you to get started with assistants. 

## Assistants vs. Chat
Chat focuses on the interaction itself, while assistants focus on providing specific services or functionalities through that interaction. Chat can be simple or complex and serves a broad range of purposes, whereas assistants are typically more structured and goal-oriented, designed to accomplish specific tasks.
- Use chat as your daily companion for brainstorming, drafting emails, and debugging code.
- Build assistants for specific, repetitive tasks. If you notice that you are using the same prompts repeatedly in chat for a particular task or topic, it's time to build an assistant. This way, you can avoid providing instructions as well as attaching documents each time.

## Assistant Builder
The Assistant Builder enables you to set up and configure your own custom assistants. We offer an interface that lets you configure the characteristics and capabilities of your assistant. To build a useful assistant, there are a few variables you need to define and you can start using your own assistants within just a few moments. 

## Building an Assistant
This is a step by step instruction on how to build and deploy custom assistants with Langdock’s Assistant Builder.


Assistant Builder consists of the following sections:
- _Icon:_ choose an icon or an emoji for your assistant that will be displayed in the chat.
- _Name:_ choose a name for your assistant that will be displayed in the chat.
- _Description:_ create a short description of your assistant that will be displayed in the chat.
- _Instructions:_ the more information you provide, the better the assistant will be. 
- _Conversation starters:_ create prompt examples for the user.
- _Knowledge:_ provide the knowledge that the Assistant can use to generate the response.
- _Model:_ choose the model that should power your assistant.
- _Creativity:_ define how creative the model should be.
- _Capabilities:_ turn on/off additional capabilities for your assistants such as Web search and Image generation.

### Let’s build an HR Assistant
Go to the “Assistants” tab in the navigation bar on the left and click on “Create assistant”.
Afterwards you will be forwarded into a pre-configured template for “Assistants”.

#### Instructions

Start by providing a name, a short description, and an icon for your assistant that will be displayed in the chat.

Next provide instructions which are the main input for the AI model, next to the prompt and knowledge. The more information you provide, the better the assistant will be. Feel free to provide examples on how the assistant should behave in certain cases. More on that in our [Prompt Engineering Guide](/few-shot-prompting).

Next, add conversation starters which represent example prompts to get the conversation started.

In the next step, you can upload your documents or select them from your integrations to customize the assistant to your specific needs. This is what makes interacting with assistants so beneficial and special in a company context. 
<br /> Furthermore, you can add other documents via the paper click in the left corner of the chat  when testing/working with the assistant.

Then you can select the model that should power your assistant as well as define how creative the model should be. The lower the creativity, the more predictable answers you will get, and vice versa. 

Finally, you can turn on/off additional capabilities for your assistants such as _Web Search_ and _Image Generation_.

After and during your assistant configuration you we highly recommend to test your assistant as much as possible on the right side of the Assistant Builder.

#### Save & share your Assistant

When the assistant is ready, you have the option to share it with others or save it for yourself. To share the assistant, click on the “Share” button in the upper right corner of the Assistant Builder, and you will be forwarded to a new window where you can define with whom do you want to share it.

#### Duplicate & delete your Assistant
Next to the “Share” button there is a 3 dots icon which enables users either to quickly duplicate the assistant or to delete it.

## Assistant Library ##
Our Assistant Library provides an overview of all assistants in your workspace. To access the Assistant Library, go to the “Assistants” tab in the navigation bar on the left.

The overview starts with a search bar where you can quickly find a desired assistant by typing its name.

The search bar is followed by the following sections:
- _Created by me:_ view assistants that you have created.
- _New at Langdock:_ view assistants that are newly created or shared with you.
- _Trending at Langdock:_ view the most used assistants in your workspace to which you have access.

You can always view all assistants and filter them by “Trending," "Most Used," and "Most Recent."
