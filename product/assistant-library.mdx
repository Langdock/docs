To access the Assistant Library, go to the “Assistants” tab in the navigation bar on the left.

The overview starts with a search bar where you can quickly find a desired assistant by typing its name.

The search bar is followed by the following sections:
- _Created by me:_ view assistants that you have created.
- _New at Langdock:_ view assistants that are newly created or shared with you.
- _Trending at Langdock:_ view the most used assistants in your workspace to which you have access.

You can always view all assistants and filter them by “Trending," "Most Used," and "Most Recent."
