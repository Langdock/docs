<Info>This feature is currently in Beta and only available for some test users.</Info>

Langdock Search is a functionality that allows users to search files, pages and content across all connected tools. In the first version, Confluence, Google Drive, OneDrive, Sharepoint and Slack are connected and searchable.

### Setting up Search
Admins can enable the feature for individual users in the [settings](https://app.langdock.com/settings/workspace/products/search). 

### Using Search
After it has been enabled, you find the search functionality in Langdock under the "Search" item in the nav bar on the top left:

Here you can search for files across all integrations. Both the title and the content are searched and you can set filters like source, file type or date.

When you found the file you were looking for, you can either open it in a new tab to work with the file, or continue to work with it in a chat.

This is the first beta version and we have a few follow up improvements planned. We are looking forward to hearing your feedback and which integrations you would like to see in Search by writing to **@Thomas Plattner** on Slack or thomas@langdock.com!
