title: 'Introduction to Assistants'
description: 'Assistants are chatbots you can set up for a specific situation or to work with a specific document. It works similarly to the chat, with the difference that you save documents and instructions to refer to the assistant without setting the chat up again.'

## Purpose of assistants
The chat is a good place to work with one-time requests or a quick request. Assistants are a good option when you want to allow others to use your work or when doing an activity you will repeat in the future. 

Assistants can perform the following operations:
- Attach documents to the assistants and chat with specific documents
Instruct an assistant to focus on a situation to have a specified chatbot
- Build a use case and share it with colleagues to make your and their work more efficient

<Info>We have created a whole library of assistants our customers set up and use every day. You can find it [here in our resource section](/resources/assistant-templates).</Info>

## Internal assistants
Most assistants are focused on internal usage to improve internal processes. Your team can use assistants in three ways: 
- **Through the platform:** You can use/share assistants and chat with them in the platform interface.
- **Via Slack:** You can add the Slack App to your Slack account and use the Assistant from within Slack. Our [guide for the Slack integration](/settings/integrations/how-to-use-slack) describes this integration in detail.
- **Via Teams (coming soon):** Similar to the Slack integration, we will release a Teams app that can be added to your Teams account so users can directly chat with assistants in Teams.

## External assistants
External assistants will be shareable outside of Langdock. As no Langdock license is required to use them, this feature will have usage-based pricing, similar to the pricing of model providers like OpenAI, Anthropic, etc.
- **Via API:** For developer use cases and other situations, it makes sense to use attached documents but send messages to an assistant outside the interface. This will allow you to build your chatbots for internal and external communication with your own interface.
- **Via Web Embed/iframe (coming soon):** If you want to add an assistant to a website for support chats, you can embed the assistant in an iframe and embed it in the page.
