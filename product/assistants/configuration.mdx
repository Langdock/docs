<Tip>For more details you can read our detailed [assistant creation guide](https://docs.langdock.com/resources/assistant-creation) of how to build an assistant.</Tip>

You have the following configuration options to customize your assistant:

**Icon, Name, and Description:** <br />
Short descriptive information to identify the assistant and describe how it works to other users

**Instructions:** <br />
Describe what you want to achieve with this assistant and define instructions. Describe as many relevant details and background information as possible. This will enable the assistant to answer better and more closely to your expectations. Read the [assistant creation guide](https://docs.langdock.com/resources/assistant-creation) and our [prompting guide](https://docs.langdock.com/resources/prompt-elements) for more details.

**Conversation Starters:** <br />
These are saved prompts the user can click on instead of writing the first message. They help guide the user and reduce the effort needed to get started.

**Knowledge:** <br />
Attach knowledge and files to your assistant.

**Model:** <br />
Choose the model this assistant will use. For details about choosing the right model, you can refer to our [model guide](https://docs.langdock.com/resources/models).

**Creativity:** <br />
AI models choose the next word or word piece (token) with probabilistic calculations. You can influence how much randomness you allow in the generation and influence the creativity.

**Capabilities:** <br />
Enable or disable different tools that are connected to the AI model, like web search, image generation, or data analysis (see [this article](https://docs.langdock.com/chat/tools) to find out more about tools).
