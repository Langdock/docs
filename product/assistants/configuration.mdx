<Tip>For more details you can read our detailed [assistant creation guide](https://docs.langdock.com/resources/assistant-creation) of how to build an assistant.</Tip>

You have the following configuration options to customize your assistant:

### Icon, Name, and Description
Short descriptive information to identify the assistant and describe how it works to other users

### Instructions
Describe what you want to achieve with this assistant and define instructions. Describe as many relevant details and background information as possible. This will enable the assistant to answer better and more closely to your expectations. Read the [assistant creation guide](https://docs.langdock.com/resources/assistant-creation) and our [prompting guide](https://docs.langdock.com/resources/prompt-elements) for more details.

### Conversation Starters
These are saved prompts the user can click on instead of writing the first message. They help guide the user and reduce the effort needed to get started.

### Knowledge
Attach knowledge and files to your assistant.

### Model
Choose the model this assistant will use. For details about choosing the right model, you can refer to our [model guide](https://docs.langdock.com/resources/models).

### Creativity
AI models choose the next word or word piece (token) with probabilistic calculations. You can influence how much randomness you allow in the generation and influence the creativity.

### Capabilities
Enable or disable different tools that are connected to the AI model, like web search, image generation, or data analysis (see [this article](https://docs.langdock.com/product/chat/tools) to find out more about tools).

### Actions
Actions are API calls that assistant can execute to retrieve, update, create or delete information in other tools. Find out how to set up actions in [this guide](https://docs.langdock.com/resources/actions).

### Sharing 
In the top right corner, you find options to share and to use the assistant. You can share it with anyone in the workspace or share editing and usage permissions with specific groups or individuals.

### Usage Insights
When clicking on the three dots, you will also find an option with usage insights. This section helps the assistant creator to optimize the assistant based on feedback from the assistant users.

There are two sections: One shows analytics for quantitative insights, like number of users, messages and conversations by time. In the second tab, you can browse through feedback users left for you by liking / disliking a response and commenting what did not work well yet. Feedback is only shared with the assistant creator, if the user actively selects to share feedback, of course.
