Creates a code completion using the [Codestral model from Mistral](https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/code_generation/).

All parameters from the [Mistral fill-in-the-middle Completion endpoint](https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/code_generation/#fill-in-the-middle-endpoint) are supported according to the Mistral specifications.

## Rate limits

The rate limit for the FIM Completion endpoint is **500 RPM (requests per minute)** and **60.000 TPM (tokens per minute)**. Rate limits are defined at the workspace level - and not at an API key level. Each model has its own rate limit. If you exceed your rate limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

Please note that the rate limits are subject to change, refer to this documentation for the most up-to-date information.
In case you need a higher rate limit, please contact us at [support@langdock.com](mailto:support@langdock.com).
