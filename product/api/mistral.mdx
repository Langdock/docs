Creates a code completion using the [Codestral model from Mistral](https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/code_generation/).

All parameters from the [Mistral fill-in-the-middle Completion endpoint](https://docs.mistral.ai/capabilities/code_generation/#fill-in-the-middle-endpoint) are supported according to the Mistral specifications.

## Rate limits

The rate limit for the FIM Completion endpoint is **500 RPM (requests per minute)** and **60.000 TPM (tokens per minute)**. Rate limits are defined at the workspace level - and not at an API key level. Each model has its own rate limit. If you exceed your rate limit, you will receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response.

Please note that the rate limits are subject to change, refer to this documentation for the most up-to-date information.
In case you need a higher rate limit, please contact us at [support@langdock.com](mailto:support@langdock.com).

## Using the Continue AI Code Assistant

Using the Codestral model, combined with chat completion models from the Langdock API, makes it possible to use the open-source AI code assistant [Continue (continue.dev)](https://continue.dev) fully via the Langdock API.

Continue is available as a [VS Code extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=Continue.continue) and as a JetBrains extension. To customize the models used by Continue, you can edit the configuration file at `~/.continue/config.json` (MacOS / Linux) or `%USERPROFILE%\.continue\config.json` (Windows).

Below is an example setup for using Continue with the Codestral model for autocomplete and Claude 3.5 Sonnet and GPT-4o models for chats and edits, all served from the Langdock API.

```json
{
  "models": [
    {
      "title": "GPT-4o",
      "provider": "openai",
      "model": "gpt-4o",
      "apiKey": "<YOUR_LANGDOCK_API_KEY>",
      "apiBase": "https://api.langdock.com/openai/eu/v1"
    },
    {

      "provider": "anthropic",
      "model": "claude-3-5-sonnet-20240620",

    }
  ],
