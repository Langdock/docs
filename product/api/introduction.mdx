## How to create API keys
Admins can create and manage API keys in the [API section](https://app.langdock.com/settings/workspace/overview) of the settings.

If you are not an admin, please approach your Langdock admin to request an API key.

## API overview
### Completion API
The basic API is the completion API, where you can use AI models in other tools or in your own built workflows. The completion API is the plain model, without any tools or attachments. You can find documentation for the completion API [here](/api/completion)

### Assistant API
You can use an assistant through the API. To do that, an admin has to share the assistant with the API key. This is described in this guide.
After connecting the assistant with the API key, you can refer to [this guide](/api/assistant) to use the assistant programmatically.

### Knowledge folder API
The knowledge folder API allows you to programmatically manage the knowledge folder, which is attached to an assistant. To use the knowledge folder API, please refer to [this guide](/api/knowledge-folder).
