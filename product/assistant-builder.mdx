Assistants are LLM-based chat interfaces that can be enriched with your company’s internal data. They are typically designed to accomplish recurring, specific tasks.

The Assistant Builder enables you to set up and configure the characteristics and capabilities of your assistant. To build a useful assistant, there are a few variables you need to define and you can start using your own assistants within just a few moments. 

You can build the assistant with the following variables:
- **_Icon:_** choose an icon or an emoji for your assistant that will be displayed in the chat.
- **_Name:_** choose a name for your assistant that will be displayed in the chat.
- **_Description:_** create a short description of your assistant that will be displayed in the chat.
- **_Instructions:_** the more information you provide, the better the assistant will be. 
- **_Conversation starters:_** create prompt examples for the user.
- **_Knowledge:_** provide the knowledge that the Assistant can use to generate the response.
- **_Model:_** choose the model that should power your assistant.
- **_Creativity:_** define how creative the model should be.
- **_Capabilities:_** turn on/off additional capabilities for your assistants such as Web search and Image generation.

## Let’s build an HR Assistant
This is a step by step instruction on how to build and deploy custom assistants with Langdock’s Assistant Builder. We are doing this with an assistant for HR, but feel free to build your assistant for an area or situation that is useful to you!

### 1. Go to the Assistant Builder
Go to https://app.langdock.com/assistants and click on **Create assistant**. You have created a new assistant which you can configure in the assistant builder.


### 2. Name and Description

Start by providing a name, a short description, and an icon for your assistant that will be displayed in the chat.

### 3. Give Instructions

Next provide instructions which are the main input for the AI model, next to the prompt and knowledge. The more information you provide, the better the assistant will be. Feel free to provide examples on how the assistant should behave in certain cases. More on that in our [Prompt Engineering Guide](/prompt-engineering/few-shot-prompting).

### 4. Conversation Starters

Next, add conversation starters which represent example prompts to get the conversation started.

### 5. Add Knowledge
In the next step, you can upload your documents or select them from your integrations to customize the assistant to your specific needs. This is what makes interacting with assistants so beneficial and special in a company context. 
<br /> Furthermore, you can add other documents via the paper click in the left corner of the chat  when testing/working with the assistant.

### 6. Select Model

Then you can select the model that should power your assistant as well as define how creative the model should be. The lower the creativity, the more predictable answers you will get, and vice versa. 

### 7. Web Search and Image Generation

Finally, you can turn on/off additional capabilities for your assistants such as _Web Search_ and _Image Generation_.

### 8. Testing the assistant
After and during your assistant configuration you we highly recommend to test your assistant as much as possible on the right side of the Assistant Builder.

### 9. Save & share your Assistant

When the assistant is ready, you have the option to share it with others or save it for yourself. To share the assistant, click on the “Share” button in the upper right corner of the Assistant Builder, and you will be forwarded to a new window where you can define with whom do you want to share it.

### 10. Duplicate & delete your Assistant
Next to the “Share” button there is a 3 dots icon which enables users either to quickly duplicate the assistant or to delete it.
