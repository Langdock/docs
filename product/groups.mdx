## General Permissions
In Langdock, there are three different types of users:

### User
- manage personal preferences (see [custom instructions](/instructions))
- create groups and manage members in the group: The creator of a group is automatically an admin for this group. They can invite and remove others and change their group permissions (see below)
- Share prompts in the prompt library and assistants with groups
- use all functionalities of the app

### Editor
- editors can do everything users can do
- additionally, they can share prompts, folders and assistants with the entire workspace

### Admin 
Admins are managing the entire workspace. This includes:
- general settings like workspace image, name, primary colour, etc.
- subscription and billing management
- member management: Inviting members and allowing specific domains
- enabling integrations (which ones can be connected by individual members)
- setting up the company's API keys for the AI model ("Bring your own model")


## Groups

Groups in Langdock are ways to organize workspaces with many files, assistants and prompts. A marketing user should be able to access copy-writing assistants quickly but does not need a coding assistant. To allow sharing assistants and prompts with relevant people, we have groups. Usually, they are a department or project team.

Everyone can create groups to collaborate with a specific set of people. You can create and view your groups in the [settings](https://platform.langdock.com/?settings=workspace&category=groups). If you do not have the button to create groups, your company uses Okta for their member management. Please get in touch with thomas@langdock.com, and we will look into it.

Within a group, assistants, prompts and chats can be shared.


There are three types of permissions in a group:
- **Viewer:** Everyone can invite other group members to shared conversations. You can only do this if you havenâ€™t used any integrations in that chat.
- **Editor:** You can share prompts and assistants with other group members.
- **Admin:** Permissions of the editor, and you can add and remove members to the group.
