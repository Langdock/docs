title: 'Personal vs. Workspace Integrations'
description: 'In Langdock there are personal integrations and workspace integrations. This page will explain the differences between them.'

## Personal Integrations
Personal integrations are only set up for the individual user setting them up. If one user connects e.g. Google Drive, it is not connected for any other user, until the other user sets it up themselves. Admins can allow or permit setting up these integrations in the settings. Personal integrations use OAuth2 and users can inly access the same files through Langdock that they can access in the according app.

## Workspace Integrations
The admins can connect integrations for the entire workspace so that individual users don't have to connect the app themselves. Langdock uses the API of the according tool, you can find out more about that in the guides for each integration. Automatically, all permissions are synchronized, so each file is synchronized with the emails that have access to it. This means that with this integration, users can only access the files they have access to in the according tool. 

To set up workspace integrations, we have prepared guides for each tool. If you have any question here or want to set up the integration together with the Langdock team, you can contact us at support@langdock.com
