title: 'Personal vs. Workspace Integrations'
description: 'In Langdock there are personal integrations and workspace integrations. Both integration types work the same for the user, the difference is that personal integrations can only be used by the specific user setting them up and workspace integrations are usable by all users after an admin set them up.'
---

## Personal Integrations
Personal integrations are only set up for the individual user setting them up. If one user connects e.g. Google Drive, it is not connected for any other user, until the other user sets it up themselves. Admins can allow or permit setting up these integrations in the settings. Personal integrations use OAuth2 and users can inly access the same files through Langdock that they can access in the according app.

## Workspace Integrations
The admins can connect integrations for the entire workspace so that individual users don't have to connect the app themselves. Langdock uses the API of the according tool, you can find out more about that in the guides for each integration. Automatically, all permissions are synchronized, so each file is synchronized with the emails that have access to it. This means that with this integration, users can only access the files they have access to in the according tool. 

To set up workspace integrations, we have prepared guides for each tool. If you have any question here or want to set up the integration together with the Langdock team, you can contact us at support@langdock.com

## How to use Integrations

Both integration types work the same for the user, the only difference is how they are set up.

### Using integrations in the Chat
To use files from your integrations, go to a [chat](https://app.langdock.com/chat) and click on the **paperclip** in the left end of the chat input field. After hovering over **Select file**, a search bar opens with which you can search for the according files. 

This search searches through all integrations, so if you have Confluence and Google Drive connected both of these apps are searched for the most fitting results. Files are sorted by relevance (how often you used them in Langdock and how recently they have been edited) to show the most relevant results for you.

### Using integrations in the Assistant
You can also use the integrations to attach knowledge to an [assistant](https://app.langdock.com/assistants). Here, you can click on **Attach** in the **Knowledge** section. The same menu opens where you can hover over **Select file** and then search through the integrations you have connected.
