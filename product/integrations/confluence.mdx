## Part 1: Import the Langdock App in your Confluence Space.

2. Open the settings and check if **Verify private listings** and **Enable Development Mode** is checked. If not, check the boxes and click “Apply”. The development mode is only temporary, while the Langdock app is being verified by Atlassian.

9. Select **Create** to create the API key.

10. Copy the values for your Organization ID and API key. Add the API key and the Organization ID to the respective fields in the Langdock app.

    <Info> Make sure you store these values in a safe place, as they won't be shown again.</Info>
