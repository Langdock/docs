title: 'How to use Integrations'
description: 'In Langdock there are personal integrations and workspace integrations. Both integration types work the same for the user, the difference is that personal integrations can only be used by the specific user setting them up and workspace integrations are usable by all users after an admin set them up.'

# How to use Integrations

Both integration types work the same for the user, the only difference is how they are set up.

## Using integrations in the Chat
To use files from your integrations, go to a [chat](https://app.langdock.com/chat) and click on the **paperclip** in the left end of the chat input field. After hovering over **Select file**, a search bar opens with which you can search for the according files. 

This search searches through all integrations, so if you have Confluence and Google Drive connected both of these apps are searched for the most fitting results. Files are sorted by relevance (how often you used them in Langdock and how recently they have been edited) to show the most relevant results for you.

## Using integrations in the Assistant
You can also use the integrations to attach knowledge to an [assistant](https://app.langdock.com/assistants). Here, you can click on **Attach** in the **Knowledge** section. The same menu opens where you can hover over **Select file** and then search through the integrations you have connected.
