## Model Selector

Langdock is a model-agnostic AI tool. That means we always provide the best AI models currently available in a GDPR-compliant setting in the EU, regardless of the model provider. You can select the current top models from OpenAI, Anthropic, Meta, Mistral, etc.
To choose a model for your next response, switch it in the top left corner of the chat. Each model has its characteristics. You can learn more about the current models in Langdock in our model guide.

## Prompt functionalities

Move the cursor of your mouse over your prompt to see the actions for this prompt.

### Edit prompt

If you are unsatisfied with a response, you can edit the prompt by clicking on the pen icon next to your prompt. Click save when you are ready. It is normal to iterate over your instructions when using AI models and provide more context where needed.

### Save prompt

If you want to reuse a prompt, save it by clicking the “+” icon. You need to choose a folder where you want to save your prompt in the prompt library and give your prompt a name. You can learn more about the prompt library here.

## Response functionalities

If you move the cursor of your mouse over the response, you can see the functionalities connected to the response.

### Copy response

If you click the copy button, the answer is saved on your computer's clipboard, and you can paste it into other tools and applications.

### Regenerate response

If you are unsatisfied with the response you received, simply click on the circular arrow below your response to regenerate it. This feature is particularly useful because models are non-deterministic, meaning you will always get a slightly different result for the same prompt. You can then review the various responses and select the one that best meets your needs. If the response is insufficient, try to edit the prompt with the **Edit prompt** button described above.
