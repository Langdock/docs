title: 'Prompt Library'
description: 'If you developed a good prompt and want to reuse it in the future, there is a prompt library to store it. You can edit it, share it with others, and use it easily in a chat or with an assistant. Prompts in the prompt library are always stored within folders. You can keep your folders private or share your folders with other users in the workspace.'

## How to add a prompt to the prompt library
- If you want to reuse a prompt you have written before, go to the prompt in a chat, hover over it, and save it by clicking on the + icon. You must choose a folder where you want to save your prompt and give it a name.

- Go directly to the library and click “Add Prompts” in the upper right corner. Here, you can enter the prompt’s name and the actual prompt and specify where to publish it.

## How to use a prompt in a chat:
- To use prompts from the prompt library, you can either click on any prompt in the library. This will open a new, empty chat with the prompt already in the prompt input field. You can change the prompt to fit your specific situation or replace placeholders.

- Another way to use a prompt is to type / in a chat. If you type /, a list opens with all possible prompts. You can click on a prompt you want to use or type a prompt and filter the list through that.

<Tip>You can combine assistants with prompts from the prompt library. More about that in this guide. </Tip>
