title: 'Plain Model'
description: 'The chat allows you to send prompts to different AI models and receive a response based on your question. You can use various tools to work with documents, search the web, or perform other operations in the chat. These tools are different capabilities the models have. Describe what you want to do, and the model will choose the right tool automatically based on your request.'

<Tip>The **more context and details** you add, the better your response because the model understands precisely what you expect. Do not miss our [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://docs.langdock.com/ressources/prompt-elements) to learn how to write great prompts.</Tip>

## Writing text
The basic functionality in the chat is to use the model without any external sources. The models have been trained on large amounts of data, making them knowledgeable of many topics. You can ask for specific definitions, ask to explain a topic for exactly your use case, or generate texts.
The typical use cases of using the plain model are:
Creating texts, like marketing copy, emails, speeches
Using the model knowledge to learn about a topic, receive definitions or explanations
Use the modelâ€™s creativity for brainstorming or receiving feedback
Writing and debugging code
