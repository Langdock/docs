<Tip>The **more context and details** you add, the **better your response** because the model understands precisely what you expect. Do not miss our [Prompt Engineering Guide](/resources/prompt-elements) to learn how to write great prompts.</Tip>

Document search is one tool the AI models have. You can add documents by either uploading them, through drag and drop or by selecting a file from an integration (how to set up integrations can be read [here](/settings/integrations/types-of-integrations).

If you attach a document to a chat, the document search tool will automatically be used. Document search extracts text from files, such as PDFs, Word documents, or PowerPoint presentations. You will find a list of all supported file types [here](/resources/faq#which-file-types-does-langdock-support).

The document's text is sent to the model in the context window, together with the prompt. The document text is then used to answer the question asked by the user.

Use cases for working with documents are:

* Summarizing texts

* Asking questions about a document

* Analyzing the files

**Limitations:**

* Models are not good at retrieving data in tables from documents. Instead, we advise using the data analyst with a CSV, Excel, or Google Sheets or screenshotting the table and working with the screenshot instead. Also, it is not possible to extract images, graphs, or symbols which are not characters.
