title: 'Image Analysis'
description: 'The chat allows you to send prompts to different AI models and receive a response based on your question. You can use various tools to work with documents, search the web, or perform other operations in the chat. These tools are different capabilities the models have. Describe what you want to do, and the model will choose the right tool automatically based on your request.'

<Tip>The **more context and details** you add, the better your response because the model understands precisely what you expect. Do not miss our [Prompt Engineering Guide](https://docs.langdock.com/ressources/prompt-elements) to learn how to write great prompts.</Tip>
 
## Image analysis (Vision)
Apart from uploading text files, you can also upload images (JPG, PNG) to the chat and let the model analyze them. This capability is called “vision”. The following models support it:
- GPT-4o
- GPT-4o mini
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Claude 3 Haiku
- Claude 3 Sonnet
- Claude 3 Opus
- Gemini 1.5 Pro
- Gemini 1.5 Flash

Image analysis is limited to images uploaded in the chat and not available in uploaded PDFs or presentations yet.
