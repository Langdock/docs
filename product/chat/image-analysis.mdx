Apart from uploading text files, you can also upload images (JPG, PNG) to the chat and let the model analyze them. This capability is called “vision”. The following models support it:
- GPT-4o
- GPT-4o mini
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet
- Claude 3 Haiku
- Claude 3 Sonnet
- Claude 3 Opus
- Gemini 1.5 Pro
- Gemini 1.5 Flash

Image analysis is limited to images uploaded in the chat and not available in uploaded PDFs or presentations yet.
