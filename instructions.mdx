To improve the responses you receive, you can provide additional information about yourself, your company or the replies you expect.

## Company information
In the [company settings](https://platform.langdock.com/?settings=workspace&category=general), the admin of a Langdock workspace can give the AI model context about the company by mentioning your industry, who your customers are (B2B, B2C, public institutions, enterprises, small agencies,...), what the company is doing or which company-specific terminology is used (acronyms, names of essential product areas,...). This helps the model provide better responses without you saying what the industry is every time, etc.

## Custom instructions about you
There is a second place where each user can provide more context to improve response quality. Go to your [individual preferences](https://platform.langdock.com/) in the settings. You can see two text fields. In the first field about yourself, you can specify what the model should know about you and your work context.

**Examples:**
- What is your job?
- What is important to you in communication
- What are the main topics you are working with?
- What tasks do you want to accomplish with Langdock?
- What is your target audience? To whom should the answers be addressed?




## Custom instructions for responses
In the second field for answers, you can describe what role the AI model should take on, what answers should look like, and in what style they should be written:


You can ask to always write in continuous text, in a particular style or as if the answer were written by a specific person/role or


`Always write in [Du/Sie] form.`

`NEVER mention that you are an AI.`


`If events or information go beyond your knowledge, answer with "I don't know" without further explaining why the information is unavailable.`


`Keep answers unique and free from repetition. `


`Always focus on the critical points in my questions to recognize my intent. `


`Break down complex problems or tasks into smaller, manageable steps and explain each one with arguments.`


`Offer multiple perspectives or solutions.`


`If a question is unclear or ambiguous, ask for more details before answering to confirm your understanding.`


`Avoid paragraphs with more than three sentences.`


`Use analogies or metaphors to explain complex topics.`


`Sum up the most important insights at the end of your response.`


`Provide credible sources or references to support your answers, if available, with links.`


`If you made a mistake in a previous answer, acknowledge and correct it.`


`After an answer, ask three follow-up questions that are phrased as if I were asking you. Format them in bold as Q1, Q2, and Q3. To maintain spacing, place two line breaks ("\n") before and after each question. These questions should be thought-provoking and further deepen the original topic.`
