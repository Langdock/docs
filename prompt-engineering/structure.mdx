title: '2) Structure Your Prompt'
---
There are several ways to structure your prompts for clarity and effectiveness. The most commonly used options are **simple delimiters** and/or **XML tags**.

## Simple Delimiters
Simple delimiters help structure your prompts and responses for greater clarity. 

Examples of simple delimiters include:
- Single quotes: `“TEXT”`
- Triple quotes: `“”” TEXT ”””`
- Triple dashes: `--- TEXT ---`
- Angle brackets: `< TEXT >`

_Prompt with angle brackets:_
<br />`Summarize the text delimited by angle brackets into a single sentence.`
<br />`< TEXT >`


## XML Tags
For more advanced structuring and complex prompts, you can incorporate XML tags. XML (eXtensible Markup Language) tags are used to define the structure and content of data.

**Structure of the tag:**
- Opening Tag: Marks the beginning of an element, enclosed in angle brackets (e.g., `<name>`).
- Closing Tag: Marks the end of an element, similar to the opening tag but includes a forward slash (e.g., `</name>`).
- Content: The data or text contained within the opening and closing tags (e.g., in `<name>John Doe</name>`, _John Doe_ is the content).

**Use the advantage of nesting tags:**
- You can nest tags for hierarchical content.

_Prompt with XML tags:_
```
<task>
    <instruction> </instruction>
    <document>
        <title> </title>
           <content>
            <paragraph id="1"> </paragraph>
        </content>
    </document>
</task>
```

## When to use delimiters and when to use XML tags?
- Use Delimiters when you need a simple separation of sections, instructions, or examples within a prompt.
- Use XML Tags when you need to represent complex, hierarchical structures, or include metadata.

<Tip>
**Hint from Langdock:** We recommend using XML tags when creating templates in any scenario where data needs to be modified by others while maintaining a consistent structure across the company or with more complex assistant instructions.
Although creating a well-structured prompt with XML tags may take time, the investment is worthwhile as it enables easy sharing and reuse within the organization.
