<AccordionGroup>
    <Accordion title="Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)">
    Type of artificial intelligence that has the ability to understand, learn, and apply knowledge across a wide range of tasks at a level comparable to human intelligence. Unlike narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks (such as image recognition or language translation), AGI aims to perform any intellectual task that a human can do.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Chat">
    A form of communication between users and LLMs, often in a conversational format, where the LLM responds to user inputs in natural language.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Code Interpreter">
    An AI tool that can understand and execute code, allowing it to perform tasks such as data analysis, calculations, and more.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Context Window">
    The range of text that an LLM can consider when generating a response. It defines how much previous conversation or text the model can "remember" at any given time.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Deep Learning (DL)">
    A subset of machine learning involving neural networks with many layers. It is used for complex tasks like image and speech recognition.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Embedding">
    A representation of data (like words or images) in a lower-dimensional space, often used to capture semantic meaning and relationships.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Few-shot Learning">
    A machine learning approach where the model is trained with a very small amount of labeled data, often just a few examples.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Fine-tuning">
    The process of taking a pre-trained model and making small adjustments to adapt it to a specific task or dataset.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tool-calling">
    The ability of an AI to call and execute specific functions or tasks, often within a larger system or application.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Hallucinations">
    Parts of an output where the model generates information that is not based on the input data or any real-world knowledge. This information output can include fabricated facts, incorrect details, or entirely fictional content that appears plausible but is not grounded in reality.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Input/Output">
    The data that is fed into an LLM (input) and the data that is produced by the system (output).
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="LLM (Large Language Model)">
    A type of AI model that is trained on vast amounts of text data to understand and generate human language.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Message">
    A unit of communication in a chat or conversation, typically consisting of text sent by a user or generated by an LLM.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="ML (Machine Learning)">
    A field of AI focused on developing algorithms that allow computers to learn from and make predictions based on data.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Neural Network">
    A computational model inspired by the human brain, consisting of interconnected nodes (neurons) that process information in layers.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Prompt">
    The input or question given to an AI model to generate a response.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)">
    A technique that combines retrieval of relevant documents or information with generation of text to improve the quality and accuracy of responses.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Token">
    A unit of text (such as a word or subword) that is processed by an LLM. 1 token is roughly equivalent to 4 characters.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Tool-calling">
    The capability of an AI to invoke external tools or APIs to perform specific tasks or retrieve information.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Vision">
    The ability of an AI system to interpret and understand visual information from the world, such as images.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Zero-shot Learning">
    A machine learning approach where the model is able to make predictions on new, unseen classes without having been explicitly trained on those classes.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="Hallucinations">
    Parts of output where the model generates information that is not based on the input data or any real-world knowledge. These outputs can include fabricated facts, incorrect details, or entirely fictional content that appears plausible but is not grounded in reality.
