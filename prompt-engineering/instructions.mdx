Providing clear and specific instructions is crucial for guiding the responses of LLMs. Vague or ambiguous prompts can lead to irrelevant or incomplete answers. Clear instructions help the LLM understand exactly what is expected, leading to more accurate and useful outputs.
Provide as many details as possible that are relevant to the prompt.

**Prompt without instructions:**
`Tell me about space.`

**Prompt with instructions:**
`Provide a brief overview of the solar system, including the names and key characteristics of each planet.`
