title: '4) Chain Prompts'
---

Divide complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps for better results.
If you write 3-4 tasks in one prompt without any structure, LLMs might overlook one or more tasks or fail to execute them well. This is connected to the concept of [Chain-of-Thought prompting](/prompt-engineering/chain-of-thought).

By breaking down the tasks, you provide a clear structure that guides LLMs through each step, ensuring comprehensive and high-quality outcomes.

## Breaking down in one prompt:
You can ask the AI model to break down a task and following the instructions step by step.

**Example:** <br />
`Search the attached documents for information about office guidelines in our Berlin office.
Then, list relevant items as bullet points and sort them by importance.
Afterwards, write a piece of concise information to post on our company's Slack channel to remind everyone about the 10 most important things to remember.`

## Breaking down in several prompts:
If a complex instruction does not work by dividing it into several steps in one prompt, try to divide this instruction into several prompts.

**Example:** <br />
>_Prompt 1:_
`Please search for our office guidelines in the Berlin office in the attached document.` <br />

_Response:_ `…`
>
>_Prompt 2:_
`Sort the guidelines by importance. Explain your reasoning.`

_Response:_ `…`
>
>_Prompt 3:_
`Write a Slack Post explaining the 10 most important guidelines.`

_Response:_ `…`
