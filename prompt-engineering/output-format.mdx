One of the simplest ways to control the output is by explicitly stating the desired format.
Langdock supports these output formats:
- JSON
- XML
- HTML
- Markdown
- Bullet points 
- Tables
- Custom defined 

**Prompt without instructions:**
`Tell me how the weather will be next week in Berlin, Hamburg and Munich.`

**Prompt with instructions:**
`Tell me how the weather will be next week in Berlin, Hamburg and Munich. Summarize the weather for each day in a markdown table with the columns <Berlin>, <Hamburg> and <Munich`>
